Sub : Request for approval attending softweare testing traing.

Dear Sridhar,

I am writing to request the opportunity to develop additional training that will benefit both myself and our company. I am confident that the training I wish to learn  will not only help me contribute more effectively to our team, but also add value to our organization.

I have researched several potential courses and training programs, including Testing, AI and Machine Learning-Based Testing. Having these additional skills will allow me to and below are the few list of benifits.
1. Higher productivity
2.Increased employee retention and reduction in costs associated with turnover (e.g., hiring and training costs)
3.More efficient, less time-consuming hiring process
4.Increased defensibility of the hiring process through the use of objective, validated metrics

I am confident that this training will not only benefit myself, but also our team and the company as a whole. I am willing to commit my time and resources to completing this training and applying what I learn to my current role and any future endeavors.

Thank you for your consideration of my request. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

T Saikumar| Program Analyst Trainee | Meta Intelligo Technologies Pvt Ltd.
